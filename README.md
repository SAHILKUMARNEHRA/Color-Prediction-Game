# Color Prediction Game

## What is this?
This is a fun little game I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You have to guess a color (Red, Blue, or Green), then hit "Spin" to see if you’re right. It’s simple but cool!

## How it Works
- Pick a color by clicking one of the buttons (Red, Blue, or Green).
- Click the "Spin" button to see the random color.
- If you guess right, you get +10 points. If you’re wrong, you lose 5 points.
- If your score goes below 0, it’s game over, but you can restart.
- It also keeps track of your best score (different for each person based on your name).

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Enter your name when it asks (so it can save your best score).
3. Click a color button, then hit "Spin".
4. Watch your score go up or down!
5. If you lose, click "Restart" to try again.

## Files
- `index.html` - The main page with the game.
- `styles.css` - Makes it look nice (colors, buttons, etc.).
- `script.js` - The code that runs the game.

## How to Run Online
1. Put all files in a GitHub repository.
2. Turn on GitHub Pages in the settings.
3. Share the link with your friends!
